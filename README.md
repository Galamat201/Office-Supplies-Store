# Office-Supplies-Store
A simple web-based office supplies (stationery) store built using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates basic e-commerce functionality such as product listing, cart management, and price calculation.

This project is my own work.

During development, I used ChatGPT as a learning and assistance tool to better understand certain parts of JavaScript logic that I was not familiar with.

Some ideas and code snippets were inspired by ChatGPT responses, but they were modified, improved, and integrated into my own implementation.
The UI layout, cart logic, and structure were customized and written by me.
